<h3> UNexpected Help  </h3>

<h4> A Small Crowd </h4>
<p> People gathered. "Na good thing to return am," someone said. Lagos wasn't all madness, after all.  </p>

<h5> Lesson of the Day </h5>
<p> Tolu thanked her, bought two boki, and gave her N500. she refude. He insisted. She smiled.  </p>

<h6> Moving On </h6>
<p> As the danfo sped off, Tolu stared out the window, thinking: Lagos has problems, but Lagos has heart.  </p>
