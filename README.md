# Frontend_basics

I Plan to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
complete small web projects,
and master responsive design along with basic frontend frameworks.
My goal is to build a portfolio of frontend roles within 6 months. 
I'm motivated by the desire to create functional, 
user-friendly websites, 
enjoy problem-solving and coding challenges, 
and gain valuable skills for a career in tech.
