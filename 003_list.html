<h4> Summary </h4>

<p> egusi soup is one of the mosy popula soupa in Nigeria. It's thick, rich, and goes well with pounded yam, semo, or eba(my favorite). </p>
<p> The flavor depends heavily on the palm oil, meat stock, and how wel you fry the egusi. Don't rush the frying step. </p>
<p> Once you get the base right, every step is straightforward. It's filling and can be stored and can be store in the freezer for later. </p>
